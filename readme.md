# Challenge 1 - Build a Personal Webpage with Pure HTML

## Description

In this assignment, you'll create a simple **personal webpage** using
only **HTML**.\
The goal is for you to demonstrate your understanding of HTML structure,
semantic elements, accessibility, and clean code formatting.

You only need to work with **one file**:

    root/
     â””â”€â”€ index.html

This assignment will help assess your ability to:

- Write correct and semantic HTML structure.\
- Apply accessibility best practices (alt text, labels, etc.).\
- Keep your code clean, consistent, and well-indented.

---

## Assignment Objectives

Your `index.html` must include the following sections:

1.  **Page Setup**
    - A proper HTML5 document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`,
      `<head>`, `<body>`).\
    - Title for the page (`<title>`).\
    - Meta tags for charset and viewport.
2.  **Header Section**
    - Use `<header>` and add a main heading (`<h1>`).\
    - Add a short paragraph about yourself (`<p>`).
3.  **Image & Links**
    - Insert an image (`<img>`) with proper `alt` attribute.\
    - Add at least one link (`<a>`) that opens in a new tab
      (`target="_blank"`).
4.  **Lists**
    - An ordered list (`<ol>`) of your top 3 favorite things.\
    - An unordered list (`<ul>`) of your hobbies.
5.  **Media Section**
    - Embed a video (YouTube via `<iframe>` or local file).\
    - Embed an audio file.
6.  **Table**
    - Create a simple table with headers (`<thead>`), body
      (`<tbody>`), and footer (`<tfoot>`).\
    - Add a caption to describe the table.
7.  **Form**
    - Add a form (`<form>`) with the following:
      - Text input (Name).\
      - Email input.\
      - Password input.\
      - Radio buttons (e.g., Gender).\
      - Checkbox (e.g., Terms agreement).\
      - Dropdown/select (e.g., City).\
      - Submit button.
8.  **Semantic Layout**
    - Use `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
      where appropriate.

---

## Important Notes

- Use **semantic tags** correctly.\
- Make sure every image has **alt text**.\
- Every form field should have a `<label>`.\
- Use comments (`<!-- -->`) in your HTML to explain sections.\
- Keep indentation consistent (2 or 4 spaces).

---

## Evaluation System

Your work will be graded using the following criteria:

1.  **HTML Structure & Semantics (50%)**
    - Correct usage of semantic tags (header, nav, section, article,
      etc.).\
    - Proper nesting and logical DOM structure.
2.  **Accessibility (30%)**
    - Use of alt attributes for images.\
    - Use of labels for form inputs.\
    - Clear and accessible structure for screen readers.
3.  **Code Clarity (20%)**
    - Consistent indentation.\
    - Descriptive names for class/id (if used).\
    - Relevant comments.
